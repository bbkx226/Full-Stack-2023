# Learning Full Stack Development
In the past two months, I've been learning full stack development and working on some mini projects to apply what I've learned. In this README, I'll provide an overview of what I've learned, the mini projects I've built, and my future learning goals.

## Technologies and Tools Used
I used the following technologies and tools to learn full stack development:

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: the core building blocks of front-end web development
- MERN stack: a popular combination of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js
- MongoDB: a document-oriented NoSQL database used for storing data
- Express: a popular web application framework for Node.js
- React: a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Node.js: a JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications
- Jest: a JavaScript testing framework for unit testing
- Cypress: a JavaScript end-to-end testing framework
- Git and GitHub: version control and collaborative development

## Mini Projects
In the past two months, I've built the following mini projects:

- Phonebook: A full-stack web application designed for managing phonebook contacts. It utilizes React for the front-end, while the back-end is built with Node.js and Express. MongoDB is used to store the data. I also employed Jest and Cypress to write unit and end-to-end tests for the application.

- Notes: A full-stack web application designed for taking and managing notes

- Country Details: A full-stack web application that provides details about a particular country, including its population, flag, and capital. The data is retrieved from a third-party API (https://restcountries.com/).

- Blogs: A full-stack web application designed for managing blog posts

## Future Learning Goals
My future learning goals for full stack development include:

- GraphQL: a query language for APIs that provides a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST APIs
- TypeScript: a superset of JavaScript that provides static type checking and other features to improve code quality and developer productivity
- React Native: a framework for building native mobile apps using React
- CI/CD: continuous integration and continuous deployment, to improve the efficiency and reliability of the software development process.

## Conclusion
In the past two months, I've learned a lot about full stack development, built several mini projects, and improved my skills in testing with Jest and Cypress. I'm excited to continue learning and exploring new technologies and tools to become a better full stack developer.
